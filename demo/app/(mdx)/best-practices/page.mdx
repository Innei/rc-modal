## Reusing components and abstractions

The advantage of invoking Modal imperatively is that it's easy to encapsulate component logic. For example, we can quickly refactor and encapsulate a declarative Modal in scenarios where it is used multiple times.

```tsx
const MyModal = ({
  open,
  onOpenChange,
}: {
  open: boolean
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void
}) => {
  return (
    <Modal
      title="A declaratively modal"
      open={open}
      onOpenChange={onOpenChange}
    >
      <p>
        This is a modal. You can put anything you want in here. And It can be
        nested.
      </p>
    </Modal>
  )
}
const Component1 = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <Button
        onClick={() => {
          setOpen(true)
        }}
      >
        Open Modal
      </Button>

      <MyModal open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen} />
    </>
  )
}

const Component2 = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <Button
        onClick={() => {
          setOpen(true)
        }}
      >
        Other biz button also use modal
      </Button>

      <MyModal open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen} />
    </>
  )
}
```

Refactoring into an imperative call Hook, so you no longer have to control the opening and closing state of the Modal within the component.

```tsx
const useMyModal = () => {
  const { present } = useModalStack()
  return useCallback(() => {
    present({
      title: "My Modal",
      content: () => (
        <p>
          This is a modal. You can put anything you want in here. And It can be
          nested.
        </p>
      ),
    })
  }, [present])
}

const Component1 = () => {
  const showModal = useMyModal()
  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={showModal}>Open Modal</Button>
    </>
  )
}

const Component2 = () => {
  const showModal = useMyModal()
  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={showModal}>Other biz button also use modal</Button>
    </>
  )
}
```

Isn't it more concise and convenient to use?
