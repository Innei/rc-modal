# Advanced Usage

## Responsive Modal

<video src="/sheet.mp4" controls playsInline />

You can control the rendering style of the Modal in different scenarios by passing the `sheet` parameter.

For example, show the style of a sheet on small-screen devices in mobile, and display the style of a modal on large-screen devices.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const isMobile = useIsMobile()
  return <ModalStackContainer sheet={isMobile}>{children}</ModalStackContainer>
}
```

If you do not pass the `sheet` parameter, the presentation style of the modal will always be that of a modal.

In the example above, a component is provided to make this scenario easier to use.

```jsx
import { MobileDetector } from "rc-modal-sheet/mobile-detector"

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ModalStackContainer>
      <MobileDetector />
      {children}
    </ModalStackContainer>
  )
}
```

## Declarative Modal

Typically, we create a stack of Modals using `useModalStack`.

```jsx
import { useModalStack } from "rc-modal-sheet"

export const Basic = () => {
  const { present } = useModalStack()
  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() => {
        present({
          title: "Modal",
          content: () => (
            <p>
              This is a modal. You can put anything you want in here. And it can
              be nested.
            </p>
          ),
        })
      }}
    >
      Open a modal
    </Button>
  )
}
```

The above is the common way, but if you want a more declarative way, you can use the `Modal` component. This way, you can avoid the problem of not being able to use Context in imperative calls.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react"
import { Modal } from "rc-modal-sheet"

export const App = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <Button
        onClick={() => {
          setOpen(true)
        }}
      >
        Open Modal
      </Button>
      <Modal title="A declaratively modal" open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
        <p>
          This is a modal. You can put anything you want in here. And It can be
          nested.
        </p>
      </Modal>
    </>
  )
}
```

import { App } from "./demo.tsx"

<App />

## Nested Modal

You can also nest Modals.

```jsx
export const NestedModal = () => {
  const { present, dismissAll } = useModalStack()
  return (
    <>
      <Button
        onClick={() => {
          present({
            title: "Nested Modal",

            content: () => (
              <div>
                Modal 1
                <Button
                  onClick={() => {
                    present({
                      title: "Nested Modal 2",
                      content: () => (
                        <div>
                          Modal 2 <br />{" "}
                          <Button onClick={dismissAll}>Dismiss All</Button>
                        </div>
                      ),
                    })
                  }}
                >
                  Open Modal 2
                </Button>
              </div>
            ),
          })
        }}
      >
        Open Nested Modal
      </Button>
    </>
  )
}
```

import { NestedModal } from "./demo.tsx"

<NestedModal />
