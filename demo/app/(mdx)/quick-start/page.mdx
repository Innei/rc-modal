# Quick Start

## Pre-use Tips

- This component uses TailwindCSS's atomic class names. If your project does not use TailwindCSS, it will not affect the use of this component; you only need to manually import the component's style file.
- This component is built on top of libraries or headless components such as Framer motion, Radix Dialog, [vaul](https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul). If your project has not imported these libraries, then you need to consider if you should worry about the additional size of the product when using this component.

## Install

```bash
npm i rc-modal-sheet
```

## Initialization

### Global Container

Add the `ModalStackContainer` component wrapper at the top of your project:

```tsx
import { motion } from "motion/react"
import { ModalStackContainer } from "rc-modal-sheet"

const App = () => (
  <ModalStackContainer m={motion}>{children}</ModalStackContainer>
)
```

If your project does not directly use Framer Motion, then you can use it like this:

```tsx
import { ModalStackContainer } from "rc-modal-sheet/motion"

const App = () => <ModalStackContainer>{children}</ModalStackContainer>
```

If your project uses [LazyMotion](https://www.framer.com/motion/lazy-motion/) from Framer Motion, then you can use it like this:

```tsx
import { ModalStackContainer } from "rc-modal-sheet/m"

const App = () => <ModalStackContainer>{children}</ModalStackContainer>
```

### Using with TailwindCSS

If your project uses TailwindCSS, add the following configuration in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  darkMode: ["class"],
  content: [
    "app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "components/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./node_modules/rc-modal-sheet/**/*.js", // Add this line
  ],
}
```

### Using in Non-TailwindCSS Projects

If your project does not use TailwindCSS, you need to manually import the component's style file:

```tsx
import "rc-modal-sheet/dist/index.css"
```

Now you can use Modals in your components.

## Simple Example

A simple example, calling to open a Modal with a hook:

```tsx
import { useModalStack } from "rc-modal-sheet"

export const Basic = () => {
  const { present } = useModalStack()
  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() => {
        present({
          title: "Modal",
          content: () => (
            <>
              <p>
                This is a modal. You can put anything you want in here. And it
                can be nested.
              </p>
            </>
          ),
        })
      }}
    >
      Open a modal
    </Button>
  )
}
```

import { Basic } from "./demo"

<Basic />
